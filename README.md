# Flux Currency Converter

Flux is a modern browser extension that seamlessly converts and localizes prices on any webpage using real-time global exchange rates. With a clean, minimal interface, Flux provides instant feedback and automatic price conversions directly on the sites you browse.

## Install

| Browser | Link |
|---|---|
| **Chrome / Other Chromium-based Browsers** | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lageadcjahlpmmbepfmehmcmbndpfkkk) |
| **Firefox** | [Manual Install](#for-firefox) *(AMO listing coming soon)* |
| **Microsoft Edge** | [Manual Install](#for-developers-manual-installation) *(Edge Add-ons listing coming soon)* |

## Features

- **Real-Time Auto-Conversion**: Automatically parses text and structured prices (e.g., on Amazon, Twitter) on the page, replacing them with your target currency.
- **Modern UI**: A fully responsive popup interface using the Space Grotesk font with a built-in Dark/Light mode toggle.
- **Smart Caching Engine**: API rates are cached locally in the browser to ensure instantaneous target currency swaps without redundant network calls.
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses debounced MutationObservers and pre-compiled regex logic to keep scrolling buttery smooth, even on infinite-scroll pages.
- **Site-Specific Controls**: You can disable Flux on a per-site basis directly from the popup using the power icon, or toggle it globally.
- **Customizable Badges**: Choose whether to display the subtle `≈` indicator next to converted prices.
- **Cross-Browser**: Works on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and any Chromium-based browser.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether it's a bug fix, new feature, or documentation improvement — here's how to get started:

### Getting Set Up

1. **Fork** this repository and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Flux-Extension.git
   cd Flux-Extension
   ```
2. **Install dependencies** (Node.js 20+ required):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your change:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

### Development Workflow

- **Lint your code** before committing — the CI will reject PRs that fail linting:
  ```bash
  npm run lint          # check for issues
  npm run lint:fix      # auto-fix what's possible
  ```
- **Load the extension locally** to test your changes:
  - Chrome → `chrome://extensions/` → Developer mode → Load unpacked
  - Firefox → `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` → Load Temporary Add-on
  - Edge → `edge://extensions/` → Developer mode → Load unpacked

### Opening a Pull Request

1. Push your branch and open a PR against `main`.
2. Your PR will go through **two automated checks** — both must pass before merging:

   | Check | What It Does |
   |---|---|
   | **lint** (GitHub Actions) | Runs `npm run lint` via ESLint to enforce code quality |
   | **CodeRabbit** (AI Review) | Performs an automated code review with suggestions and feedback |

3. A maintainer will review and approve once all checks pass.

> **Branch Rules**: The `main` branch is protected — all changes must come through a PR with at least 1 approval and passing status checks. Direct pushes to `main` are blocked.
